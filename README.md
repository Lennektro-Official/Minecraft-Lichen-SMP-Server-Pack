# Minecraft Lichen SMP Server Pack
[Logo Here]
### General Info
The Lichen SMP is a little minecraft server project that I created for me and my friends. I coded some plugins to spice up the vanillla gameplay a little bit and added utility features for multiplayer and server administration. This is manly a collection of plugins that I coded for 1.18.2, but most plugins should also work in the 1.19 versions.
### Plugin List
- [Any Hat]()
- [Boox]()
- [Cake Utils]()
- [Deco Heads]()
- [Demo Troll]()
- [Glass Item Frames]()
- [Grave Stoned]()
- [Improved Armor Stands]()
- [Inv Shulker Box]()
- [Pleasent Ladders]()
- [PL Text]()
- [Smart Harvest]()
- [Smart Sleep]()
- [Too Social]()
### Resource Pack
The Resource Pack contains a texture for the Glass Item Frames and a Lichen SMP logo for the player list. It's totally optional but adds a nice little touch. The char for the logo is ```\ue400``` which is also the only unicode char PL Text supports. You can just download the zip and put it in your resourcepacks directory.
### Author's Config
The directory *authors_config* contains all the config files of the plugins how I use them on my server.
